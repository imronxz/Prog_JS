TODO Asynchronous
1) Asynchronous code is executed after a tast that runs in the background finished

2) Asynchronous code is non-blocking

3) Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finis its work;

4) Callback function alone do NOT make code asynchronous!

contoh:
const img = document.querySelector('.dog');
img.src = 'dog.jpg';
img.addEventListener('load',function (){
      img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
p.style.width = '300px'

TODO AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML)
Allows us to communicate with remote web server in an asynchronous way.
With AJAX calls, we can request data from web server dynamically.

(CLIENT) --> (WEB SERVER) : Asking for some data REQUEST(GET/POST)
(CLIENT) <-- (WEB SERVER) : Sending data back RESPONSE

TODO API (Application Programming Interface)
1) PIece of software that can be used by another piece of software,
   in order to allow applications to talk to each other;

2) There are be many types of APIs in web development;
   1. DOM API * 2. Geolocation API * 3 4. Online API

3) Online API Application running on a server, that receives request for data, and sends data back as response;

4) We can build our own web APIs (required back-end development, e.g with node js) or use 3rd-party APIs
